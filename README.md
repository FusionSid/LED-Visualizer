# LED Visualizer for Piano

Basically I have a light strip hooked up to a raspberry pi and whenever I click a key on my piano, the pi takes in the midi data and lights up the leds corresponding to that key

# Todo
- [ ] Use a microcontroller as a pi is sorta overkill
- [x] Rewrite the code in lib.py currently I sorta scrambled it together, so make it cleaner
- [ ] Add more settings to the web interface and make the UI look nice
- [ ] Have idle states like gradients or lighting up the whole strip to a soft white or something like that (first gotta buy a more higher amperage power supply though)

### What it looks like:
