# LED Visualizer for Piano

Basically I have a light strip hooked up to a raspberry pi and whenever I click a key on my piano, the pi takes in the midi data and lights up the leds corresponding to that key

# Todo
- [ ] Use a microcontroller as a pi is sorta overkill
- [ ] Rewrite the code (currently it is all in one file and put together to *just* work)
- [ ] Add smth to control the colors (right now I have two modes, random color or fixed color but maybe I could make a web UI)
- [ ] Have idle states like gradients or lighting up the whole strip to a soft white or something like that
